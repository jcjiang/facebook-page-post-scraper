If you want a comprehensive list, there are thousands of books and articles on the subject.

In this case, the limit between what is appropriate and wrong is hard to define by law as in some cases  the same situation might be mutually experienced as consensual and others completely unwanted by one of the parties. Framing it in laws will basically reduce the freedom of all other men and women by forcing a point of view on what is acceptable or not in a universal way, which is not the case. Then litigation gain expectations will grow the problem exponentially like it always does when you subsidize a problem by law or government redistribution. Of course this does not excuse the behavior of many people (the majority men) who either out of lack of manners and stupidity or premeditated abuse disregard the feelings of/ disrespect the other party (usually women). I think the best answer is education (parental and society), as well as the tolerance of violent retaliation against the aggressor in the event he disregards the victim‚Äôs expression of disagreement.

Perhaps this narrative will prove sufficient, but my concern is that it focuses on many issues about behavior modification rather than focusing on educating youth to have a different perspective on gender. It's also possible that this could have a trickle down effect, where parents who learn the lessons through this movement pass it down to their kids, but I'm not as optimistic about that.

There is a great episode of This American Life ( I can't find it) where they hid the gender of their child for years and the results were really fascinating - she grew up with an openness and confidence that is truly rare in our society.

I also see the pendulum swinging to the other extreme, where many of us will just not bother interacting at all with the opposite gender due to the corrosive intellectual environment that is being created. We were supposed to be complementary. The conversation now reeks of all out war. As such, birth rates will drop even quicker (not entirely a bad thing) and marriages will be even rarer as interactions become more and more scarce and politics-ridden.

So you sit down and listen to what is needed from you, and then you do it and speak out for what other women need.
If I support the rights of any other groups whose experiences I don't share, like LGBT rights, I wouldn't dare to tell them what they need. I listen to what is needed and ask how I can help.",undiscoverable,2018-02-04 04:50:42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No, men are not 'all kind of guilty'. Perpetrators of abuse and harassment can be male or female, homosexual or heterosexual, and the victims of harassment/abuse include men and women.

So great that by 2000, our air and water was clean again.  As clean as in the 1950s.  But to admit that, the EPA would legitimately have reduce its employee base.  God forbid a government entity reduce its ranks, so the EPA has continued to change the rules and the measurements to justify its bloated existence.  We are not polluting the world.  Please shift your world pollution attacks to China and India.  

Meanwhile, the EPA has become a rogue agency that needs a major reduction in force to become a more legitimate oversight agency.  It could easily go from a 15,000 employment agency to under 10,000 or maybe even a 5,000 population agency.  I say again, our air and water is clean.  Much cleaner than we should expect.

I dont believe that NYT again writes untruth. - In the course of the Polish-Ukrainian fights of 1918-1919 for the city of Lviv, a Jewish Militia was created - this militia according to The agreement with the Polish Army was to remain neutral, but in reality it was anti-Polish and fought on the Ukrainians side. They shot at the Polish defenders of Lw√≥w, threw grenades from the windows. Many were killed during the fighting. For treason met them the court-martial and punishment but not by the regular army, but by ""freelance"" & deserters. At that time, according to the ""Jewish Rescue Committee,"" 72 Jews died and several hundred were wounded.
The Poles were not negatively for the Jews. NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF POLISH MILITIES IN THE LW√ìW. DAILY RECORD No. 10. Lviv, November 13, 1918.
XIV. Receiving Jews.
""Jews who voluntarily submit to the Polish army should be accepted and treated as completely equal Poles."" - Compatibility: Garbien Adj. Maczynski, Mr. Commander-in-Chief.
November 14, 1918 Lviv Zamarstyn√≥w - Jews indicate Polish families for murdering, was killed at least 40 Poles.
The same situation as in Lviv was after the fighting for Vilnius, 50 Jews were killed for shooting Poles and supporting the Bolsheviks.
In Pinsk during the Polish-RussianBolshevik War, 35 Jews were killed for allegedly illegal gathering - I do not justify this murder, it was a condemned misunderstanding.
These cases were investigated by four different commissions from the USA, GB - The Morgenthau report did not consider it a massacre but excesses during the conduct of two wars with Ukrainians and Bolsheviks. The Morgenthau Committee reported that the Polish authorities were not the initiators of the incidents, and the Second Republic tried to curb any symptoms of anti-Semitism.

IMPORTANT: This is not about the fact that they were a Jews, but about the fact that they were Bolsheviks / communists seeking to break up Poland for the USSR.

However, what happened to the Jews in the USSR and Ukraine can be clearly called ""pogroms of Jews."" (but NYT is silent about this, he prefers to accuse Poles) In the years 1918-1920, there were 1500 pogroms in over 1,300 towns in Ukraine in which 50,000 to 250,000 Jews were murdered.
Let me give you some examples:
7.03.1918 Hlukhiv, - 400 murdered Jews.
15.02.1919 Proskurov - 1,600 Jews murdered.
18.02.1919 Skelivka - 600 murdered Jews.
05.1919 Radomyshl - 500-1000 murdered Jews.
15-17.05.1919 Yelisavetgrad - 1300-3000 murdered Jews.
16-20.05.1919 Cherkasy - 700 murdered Jews.
11.07.1919 Tulchyn - 519 murdered Jews.
11.08.1919 Yelisavetgrad - 1000 murdered Jews.
23-26.09.1919 Fastiv - 1800 murdered Jews.
16-20.10.1919 Kiev - 1,600 Jews murdered.
26/03/1920 Tetiiv - 5000 murdered Jews.
It is also worth recalling the Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire 1881-1906
The communist plague also did not treat better Poles see: The Polish Operation of the Soviet NKVD security service in 1937‚Äì1938 at least 111,091 Poles were murdered for being Poles.
Let me also recall the murder of 100 Polish patients of the hospital in P≈Çock by the Bolsheviks on 18.08.1920 Apropo of the article. After the Polish-Russian War of 1919-1921, Russian prisoners died en masse on Spanish flu.",undiscoverable,2018-01-31 20:33:18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Why does Trump still have a job? Why does he get a pass on this??

Trump supporters think he will build a wall, kick a bunch of brown people out, and most importantly, Make America ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù Again. They hope he will get rid of Obamacare, which ironically, will hurt them the most. Under Obamacare, my pre-existing condition is insured. Before it, I struggled to make payments. Under the exchange, I pay just $200/month for health insurance. Also - My car insurance is down to $25/month (from Insurance-Panda). My renters insurance is just $10/month. Under Trump, America will become too unaffordable to live in. 

If only we could go back in a time machine and have NBC apply the same standards for sexual misconduct to Donald Trump during his 12 years at the Apprentice, maybe we would not have to put up with him as president.",undiscoverable,2018-01-31 10:17:05,4,3,0,1,0,0,0,0

 I'm really horrified to have Trump as our president. He's supposed to be an ambassador for this country. Makes us look like undignified monkeys.

Here is what his support base believe he will do:

1. Kill little Kimmy.
2. Get rid of a bunch of brown people.
3. Get rid of Obamacare and watch the poor die. My previously unaffordable insurance is down to just $85/month. My car insurance, from Insurance Panda, is now just $25/month. Under Trump, healthcare will be $500/month or more.
4. Make the lives of poor kids, the sick, and the elderly worse than they already are.
5. Drop a bunch of bombs on some colored people in some country somewhere.
6. Cut taxes on the rich.

Stop supporting the other person just because you dislike someone else.  Clinton disparaged handicapped children while First Lady, Clinton covered up her husband's sexual abuses of staffers, Clinton attacked and destroyed the lives of the women her husband cheated with, Clinton covered up the sexual harrassment in her own campaign, Clinton conspired with the DNC to cheat Bernie Sanders out of the nomination.

She is absolute and utter scum, but somehow you support her because Trump is absolute and utter scum.  Stop being hypocrites and learn how to hate them both.  Oh, Fire and Fury has been railed on by several sources as being a flawed lie.  Even the author stated in defense ""If it sounds like the truth, and feels like the truth, it is the truth.""
